#### **Linear/sequential search**
Linear search algo is very simple and its time complexity O(n).

`Algorithm : linearSearch(searchElement)`\
`Start:`\
`Step 1: 	found = false`\
`Step 2: 	iterate all “element” of data structure and perform step 3`\
`Step 3: 	if(searchElement == element)`\
			`then perform step 4 & step 5.`\
`Step 4 : 	found = true`\
`Step 5: 	break`\
`Step 6: 	return found`\
`end:`
